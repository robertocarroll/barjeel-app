	"description": "The body fragments anxiously. A flâneur in a city of bitter disappointments. In Cairo the walker is assaulted in the street; sermons blare through loud speakers, women feel men’s sharp gazes upon them, tanks appear. Resistance: reversing the gaze, erasing oneself, recognising the masquerade of identity; gender, race, class. Destabilise the performance of power then imagine an alternative future.",
